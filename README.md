# About this project

- This is a chatbot for world capitals.
- If you ask it any country's capital with this specific sentence, 'capital of (country in all lowercase)' (no brackets btw it is just to show you insert whatever country), it will respond with the capital.
- If you say 'cat' to it, it's gonna randomly generate an image of a cat.
- And if you say '안녕' to it it's gonna say smth like '안녕! 만나서 반가워." 
- And if you ask it '기분이 어때?' it will give you a random response about how it's feeling (in Korean).
